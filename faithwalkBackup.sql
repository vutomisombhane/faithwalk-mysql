That same nature is imparted to your spirit when you receive Christ into your heart to be born again. Then, you&#x27;re automatically brought into oneness with God; His character of rightness is wrought in your spirit. The result of this is that you can stand in God&#x27;s presence with boldness, without condemnation, inferiority or guilt; because you&#x27;ve become the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21).</p><p data-block-key=\"75jpm\">God expects you to live this life of righteousness daily. Your life should be the expression of the life He&#x27;s given you. For example, when a child is born, he is naturally human; but he starts building and developing his innate human characteristics. He doesn&#x27;t have the nature of a dog or camel, but of a human being. But he must develop that nature through knowledge and fellowship with other humans. In the same way, when you become a child of God, you automatically receive the righteousness of God. Even if you err, it wouldn&#x27;t be because you&#x27;re no longer righteous, but because you haven&#x27;t grown or matured in the knowledge of God. A child, who&#x27;s not taught how to walk, may never walk; not because he doesn&#x27;t have the ability to walk but because he was never taught. Likewise, to grow as a mature Christian and be able to live righteously to the glory of God, you must be taught to live by God&#x27;s Word.</p><p data-block-key=\"2cggp\">This is one of the reasons you must become a committed member of a local church. In church, you&#x27;re taught how to live the life of righteousness which you&#x27;ve received in Christ Jesus. As you live out that righteousness, many will witness the perfection and inner beauty of divinity in you; God&#x27;s nature of rightness, excellence, and perfection will be manifested in everything you do.</p>',2),(11,'2021-12-02','<p data-block-key=\"496xs\">Hagar faces a terrible time of rejection. Sarah became jealous of Ishmael, the son of Hagar the bond woman. She asked Abraham to send Hagar and her son away. saying that Ishmael was not going to have a share in her son&#x27;s inheritance. Abraham was troubled. it broke his heart to send his son away, but God said he should because He has a plan for Ishmael.  Abraham listened to God and sent Hagar and Ishmael away. The word of God says that they wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. We all know the dangers of the wilderness. There is no water, shelter. there are wild animals, bandits etc.</p><p data-block-key=\"3se3\">while still wandering in the wilderness, the water got finished. She didn&#x27;t know what to do. she thought her child was going to die. she put the child under one of the shrubs, went away, for she said,let me not see the death of my child. sometimes we find ourselves in similar situations. The burdens of life become so heavy that we think we cannot bear them. David found himself in hopeless situation and he wanted to fly away. Psalm 55 v 1-8</p><p data-block-key=\"f5o1g\">Even when the burdens of life exceeds our ability to bear them, they never exceeds God&#x27;s ability. 2 Corinthians 1 v 9-10. Hagar should not have been worried, she had the promise of God that he was going to make Ishmael the father of a great nation. Gen 16 v 10-11. Sometimes life hurts so much that we forget the promises of God in our lives. What we fail to see is that our pain is the path God uses to fulfill the promises He has made to us.   </p><p data-block-key=\"538lv\">the truth is the problems are going to come into our lives, and they will come unannounced and they will hurt us badly. so when they come, we must run to the Lord. He will hear us and He will help us. In verse 16, Hagar sat down and wept. we may ask ourselves why she didn&#x27;t pray                                                     </p>',NULL),(17,'2022-02-25','<p data-block-key=\"hv4vy\">The Lord Jesus, in our opening scripture, said to His disciples that the harvest is plenty, but the labourers are few. The harvest He&#x27;s referring to are the souls of men. He&#x27;s talking about the world of sinners. The labourers, on the other hand, refer to those who are reaching out with the Gospel to win these lost souls to Christ. As a Christian, someone made it possible for you to hear and receive salvation. So what are you doing to let someone else know about Jesus?</p><p data-block-key=\"aei76\">The one passion that dominated the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus while He walked the earth was harvesting the souls of men into the Kingdom of God. That was the reason He came: <b><i>&quot;...Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners...&quot;</i></b> (1 Timothy 1:15). Luke 19:10, says, <b><i>&quot;For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;</i></b> Salvation for the lost was all that mattered to Him. He told His disciples once, <b><i>&quot;...My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work&quot;</i></b> (John 4:34).</p><p data-block-key=\"6ah82\">The Bible lets us know <b><i>&quot;...that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation&quot;</i></b> (2 Corinthians 5:19). What this implies is that God has already reconciled the ungodly, the wicked, the robbers, the terrorists, the fraudsters, etc., unto Himself. These need to be told that God is not mad at them; He loves them dearly and is not holding their sins against them. Only through the Gospel of Christ can they truly have a change of heart -a new life!</p><p data-block-key=\"9m89k\">The Gospel of Christ is the only hope for any nation or people. It&#x27;s only through the preaching of the Gospel that we can harvest and bring into the Kingdom the many souls that are languishing in darkness. Go out today and lead someone to Jesus. Take your ministry of the Gospel very seriously.</p><h4 data-block-key=\"4gfn3\"><b>Prayer</b></h4><p data-block-key=\"a04lg\"><b>Dear Father, I&#x27;ve set my heart to be faithful to the call of leading the unsaved in my world to Christ.

Sarah became jealous of Ishmael, the son of Hagar the bond woman. She asked Abraham to send Hagar and her son away. saying that Ishmael was not going to have a share in her son&#x27;s inheritance. Abraham was troubled. it broke his heart to send his son away, but God said he should because He has a plan for Ishmael. Abraham listened to God and sent Hagar and Ishmael away. The word of God says that they wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. We all know the dangers of the wilderness. There is no water, shelter, there are wild animals, bandits etc.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"3se3\\\">W=hile still wandering in the wilderness, the water got finished. She didn&#x27;t know what to do. she thought her child was going to die. she put the child under one of the shrubs, went away, for she said,let me not see the death of my child. sometimes we find ourselves in similar situations. The burdens of life become so heavy that we think we cannot bear them. David found himself in hopeless situation and he wanted to fly away. Psalm 55 v 1-8</p><p data-block-key=\\\"f5o1g\\\">Even when the burdens of life exceeds our ability to bear them, they never exceeds God&#x27;s ability. 2 Corinthians 1 v 9-10. Hagar should not have been worried, she had the promise of God that he was going to make Ishmael the father of a great nation. Gen 16 v 10-11. Sometimes life hurts so much that we forget the promises of God in our lives. What we fail to see is that our pain is the path God uses to fulfill the promises He has made to us.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"538lv\\\">the truth is the problems are going to come into our lives, and they will come unannounced and they will hurt us badly. so when they come, we must run to the Lord. He will hear us and He will help us. In verse 16, Hagar sat down and wept. we may ask ourselves why she didn&#x27;t pray. why cry instead of praying. Hagar didn&#x27;t know, but God had been there the whole time. He called her by her name. He won&#x27;t leave you either. You will never live one second of your life or take one step as a child of God without Him.

Hagar should not have been worried, she had the promise of God that he was going to make Ishmael the father of a great nation. Gen 16 v 10-11. Sometimes life hurts so much that we forget the promises of God in our lives. What we fail to see is that our pain is the path God uses to fulfill the promises He has made to us.   </p><p data-block-key=\\\"538lv\\\">the truth is the problems are going to come into our lives, and they will come unannounced and they will hurt us badly. so when they come, we must run to the Lord. He will hear us and He will help us. In verse 16, Hagar sat down and wept. we may ask ourselves why she didn&#x27;t pray                                                     </p>\", \"wagtail_admin_comments\": [], \"gallery_images\": [{\"pk\": 7, \"sort_order\": 0, \"page\": 11, \"image\": \"photos/christsheep.jpg\", \"caption\": \"\"}]}',NULL,11,1),(74,0,'2022-02-25 12:55:48.425552','{\"pk\": 17, \"path\": \"0001000100010008\", \"depth\": 4, \"numchild\": 0, \"translation_key\": \"cc00a790-9b57-4213-aa46-d1d064542cc3\", \"locale\": 1, \"title\": \"Join in the harvest\", \"draft_title\": \"Join in the harvest\", \"slug\": \"join-in-the-harvest\", \"content_type\": 44, \"live\": true, \"has_unpublished_changes\": true, \"url_path\": \"/faith-daily-walk-with-god/devotionals/join-in-the-harvest/\", \"owner\": 1, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"search_description\": \"\", \"go_live_at\": null, \"expire_at\": null, \"expired\": false, \"locked\": false, \"locked_at\": null, \"locked_by\": null, \"first_published_at\": \"2022-02-25T10:32:31.895Z\", \"last_published_at\": \"2022-02-25T10:45:09.205Z\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2022-02-25T11:27:17.344Z\", \"live_revision\": 59, \"alias_of\": null, \"date\": \"2022-02-25\", \"body\": \"<p data-block-key=\\\"hv4vy\\\">The harvest season is always a time of joy to farmers.

That same nature is imparted to your spirit when you receive Christ into your heart to be born again. Then, you&#x27;re automatically brought into oneness with God; His character of rightness is wrought in your spirit. The result of this is that you can stand in God&#x27;s presence with boldness, without condemnation, inferiority or guilt; because you&#x27;ve become the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21).</p><p data-block-key=\\\"75jpm\\\">God expects you to live this life of righteousness daily. Your life should be the expression of the life He&#x27;s given you. For example, when a child is born, he is naturally human; but he starts building and developing his innate human characteristics. He doesn&#x27;t have the nature of a dog or camel, but of a human being. But he must develop that nature through knowledge and fellowship with other humans. In the same way, when you become a child of God, you automatically receive the righteousness of God. Even if you err, it wouldn&#x27;t be because you&#x27;re no longer righteous, but because you haven&#x27;t grown or matured in the knowledge of God. A child, who&#x27;s not taught how to walk, may never walk; not because he doesn&#x27;t have the ability to walk but because he was never taught. Likewise, to grow as a mature Christian and be able to live righteously to the glory of God, you must be taught to live by God&#x27;s Word.</p><p data-block-key=\\\"2cggp\\\">This is one of the reasons you must become a committed member of a local church. In church, you&#x27;re taught how to live the life of righteousness which you&#x27;ve received in Christ Jesus. As you live out that righteousness, many will witness the perfection and inner beauty of divinity in you; God&#x27;s nature of rightness, excellence, and perfection will be manifested in everything you do.</p>\", \"wagtail_admin_comments\": [], \"gallery_images\": [{\"pk\": 6, \"sort_order\": 0, \"page\": 10, \"image\": \"photos/login.jpg\", \"caption\": \"\"}]}',NULL,10,1),(78,0,'2022-02-25 13:24:24.400403','{\"pk\": 5, \"path\": \"00010001\", \"depth\": 2, \"numchild\": 4, \"translation_key\": \"62b12729-7c79-4fab-95c8-74ba64f379e3\", \"locale\": 1, \"title\": \"Faith - daily walk with God\", \"draft_title\": \"Faith - daily walk with God\", \"slug\": \"faith-daily-walk-with-god\", \"content_type\": 2, \"live\": true, \"has_unpublished_changes\": true, \"url_path\": \"/faith-daily-walk-with-god/\", \"owner\": 1, \"seo_title\": \"\", \"show_in_menus\": false, \"search_description\": \"\", \"go_live_at\": null, \"expire_at\": null, \"expired\": false, \"locked\": false, \"locked_at\": null, \"locked_by\": null, \"first_published_at\": \"2021-11-12T09:47:28.214Z\", \"last_published_at\": \"2021-11-30T10:54:59.538Z\", \"latest_revision_created_at\": \"2022-02-25T11:46:09.879Z\", \"live_revision\": 32, \"alias_of\": null, \"body\": \"<p data-block-key=\\\"acp7e\\\">Welcome to faithwalk</p>\", \"header\": 1, \"featured_posts_sub_heading\": \"Love is one of the most important principles of a Christian\'s life; our Lord Jesus specifically commanded us to love one another.\", \"wagtail_admin_comments\": [], \"featured_posts\": [{\"pk\": null, \"sort_order\": 0, \"page\": 5, \"post\": 17}, {\"pk\": null, \"sort_order\": 1, \"page\": 5, \"post\": 10}]}',NULL,5,1);

That same nature is imparted to your spirit when you receive Christ into your heart to be born again. Then, you\'re automatically brought into oneness with God; His character of rightness is wrought in your spirit. The result of this is that you can stand in God\'s presence with boldness, without condemnation, inferiority or guilt; because you\'ve become the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21). God expects you to live this life of righteousness daily. Your life should be the expression of the life He\'s given you. For example, when a child is born, he is naturally human; but he starts building and developing his innate human characteristics. He doesn\'t have the nature of a dog or camel, but of a human being. But he must develop that nature through knowledge and fellowship with other humans. In the same way, when you become a child of God, you automatically receive the righteousness of God. Even if you err, it wouldn\'t be because you\'re no longer righteous, but because you haven\'t grown or matured in the knowledge of God. A child, who\'s not taught how to walk, may never walk; not because he doesn\'t have the ability to walk but because he was never taught. Likewise, to grow as a mature Christian and be able to live righteously to the glory of God, you must be taught to live by God\'s Word. This is one of the reasons you must become a committed member of a local church. In church, you\'re taught how to live the life of righteousness which you\'ve received in Christ Jesus. As you live out that righteousness, many will witness the perfection and inner beauty of divinity in you; God\'s nature of rightness, excellence, and perfection will be manifested in everything you do.','The Righteousness Of God In You'),(27,'11',0.9129464285714286,44,'God has a plan for your life','None Hagar faces a terrible time of rejection. Sarah became jealous of Ishmael, the son of Hagar the bond woman. She asked Abraham to send Hagar and her son away. saying that Ishmael was not going to have a share in her son\'s inheritance. Abraham was troubled. it broke his heart to send his son away, but God said he should because He has a plan for Ishmael.  Abraham listened to God and sent Hagar and Ishmael away. The word of God says that they wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. We all know the dangers of the wilderness. There is no water, shelter. there are wild animals, bandits etc. while still wandering in the wilderness, the water got finished. She didn\'t know what to do. she thought her child was going to die. she put the child under one of the shrubs, went away, for she said,let me not see the death of my child. sometimes we find ourselves in similar situations. The burdens of life become so heavy that we think we cannot bear them. David found himself in hopeless situation and he wanted to fly away. Psalm 55 v 1-8 Even when the burdens of life exceeds our ability to bear them, they never exceeds God\'s ability. 2 Corinthians 1 v 9-10. Hagar should not have been worried, she had the promise of God that he was going to make Ishmael the father of a great nation. Gen 16 v 10-11. Sometimes life hurts so much that we forget the promises of God in our lives. What we fail to see is that our pain is the path God uses to fulfill the promises He has made to us.    the truth is the problems are going to come into our lives, and they will come unannounced and they will hurt us badly. so when they come, we must run to the Lord. He will hear us and He will help us. In verse 16, Hagar sat down and wept. we may ask ourselves why she didn\'t pray','God has a plan for your life'),(30,'14',3.131575,50,'About Us','','About Us'),(31,'15',1.75,50,'Privacy Policy','','Privacy Policy'),(32,'16',1.50595,50,'Terms and Conditions','','Terms and Conditions'),(33,'17',1.2655526315789474,44,'Join in the harvest','1 The Lord Jesus, in our opening scripture, said to His disciples that the harvest is plenty, but the labourers are few. The harvest He\'s referring to are the souls of men. He\'s talking about the world of sinners. The labourers, on the other hand, refer to those who are reaching out with the Gospel to win these lost souls to Christ. As a Christian, someone made it possible for you to hear and receive salvation. So what are you doing to let someone else know about Jesus? The one passion that dominated the life and ministry of the Lord Jesus while He walked the earth was harvesting the souls of men into the Kingdom of God. That was the reason He came: \"...Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners...\" (1 Timothy 1:15). Luke 19:10, says, \"For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\" Salvation for the lost was all that mattered to Him. He told His disciples once, \"...My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work\" (John 4:34). The Bible lets us know \"...that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation\" (2 Corinthians 5:19). What this implies is that God has already reconciled the ungodly, the wicked, the robbers, the terrorists, the fraudsters, etc., unto Himself. These need to be told that God is not mad at them; He loves them dearly and is not holding their sins against them. Only through the Gospel of Christ can they truly have a change of heart -a new life! The Gospel of Christ is the only hope for any nation or people. It\'s only through the preaching of the Gospel that we can harvest and bring into the Kingdom the many souls that are languishing in darkness. Go out today and lead someone to Jesus. Take your ministry of the Gospel very seriously. Prayer Dear Father, I\'ve set my heart to be faithful to the call of leading the unsaved in my world to Christ. I thank you for the increased grace you\'ve granted me to be faithful in this endeavour, in Jesus\' Name. Amen.','Join in the harvest');
